Frame interfaces with the Ethereum network and signature providers (such as a Ledger or Trezor) to create an OS-level provider that can be used with any web, desktop or command-line dapp. Frame was created to be a user-friendly way to securely and transparently interact with dapps and the Ethereum network.

### Features
- **First-class Hardware Support**
  - Use your Ledger and Trezor devices with any dapp!
- **Permissions**
  - Control which dapps have permission to access your provider and monitor with full transparency what requests dapps are making.
- **Node Management**
  - Frame simplifies running and syncing your local node and lets you seamlessly swap from local to remote nodes on the fly.
- **Menu Bar Support**
  - Frame stays out of the way and sits quietly in your menu bar until it's needed.
- **Cross Platform**
  - macOS, Windows and Linux!
  
### Downloads
  - **Frame is currently under development.** macOS, Windows and Linux distributions will be made available soon.
